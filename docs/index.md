# Getting Started

## What is this?

*txtdot* is a proxy that requests the page by the given URL,
extracts only useful data (text, links, pictures, tables, etc.)
and returns it as an HTML page with a minimalistic design
optimized for reading text.

*txtdot* increases the loading speed and reducing client's bandwidth usage
since no unnecessary code and no scripts are transfered.
